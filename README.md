# Issue
<code>strict-origin-when-cross-origin</code>
**CORS Policy** - CORS is a security mechanism that allows a web page from one domain or Origin to access a resource with a different domain (a cross-domain request). CORS is a relaxation of the same-origin policy implemented in modern browsers. Without features like CORS, websites are restricted to accessing resources from the same origin through what is known as same-origin policy. The error stems from a security mechanism that browsers implement called the same-origin policy.
