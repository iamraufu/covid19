# Issue
**CORS Policy** - CORS is a security mechanism that allows a web page from one domain or Origin to access a resource with a different domain (a cross-domain request). CORS is a relaxation of the same-origin policy implemented in modern browsers. Without features like CORS, websites are restricted to accessing resources from the same origin through what is known as same-origin policy. The error stems from a security mechanism that browsers implement called the same-origin policy.

# Solution
Check Console for the error and <code>sessionStorage.clear()</code> then refresh the page.
